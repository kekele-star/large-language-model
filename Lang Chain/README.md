## Introduction

LangChain is a language model project that leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to create a versatile tool for natural language understanding and generation. Whether you are interested in chatbots, language translation, or text summarization, LangChain provides a robust framework to explore and implement these applications.

## Installation

To get started with the LangChain ML Project, follow the steps below:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kekele-star/langchain-ml-project.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd langchain-ml-project

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

The LangChain model can be used for various language-related tasks. Here's a simple example of how to use it for text generation:

```python
from langchain import LangChainModel

# Create an instance of the LangChainModel
lang_chain = LangChainModel()

# Generate text
generated_text = lang_chain.generate_text("Input text for generation.")

print(generated_text)
```

For more detailed usage instructions and examples, refer to the documentation in the `docs` folder.

## Model Architecture

The LangChain model is built on top of the latest advancements in natural language processing. The architecture includes components for pre-processing, feature extraction, and deep learning models tailored for language understanding and generation.

For a detailed overview of the model architecture, see the `docs/model_architecture.md` file.

## Training

If you wish to train the LangChain model on your custom dataset, refer to the `docs/training_guide.md` for step-by-step instructions.

## Evaluation

Details on evaluating the model's performance can be found in the `docs/evaluation.md` file. This includes metrics, datasets, and best practices for assessing the model's effectiveness.
